# 🌍 Terraform – Infrastructure as Code

Terraform is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure (servers, storage, networking, databases, etc.) using simple configuration files.

Instead of manually creating infrastructure from the cloud console, Terraform lets you **automate the process** — saving time, reducing errors, and making deployments consistent.

---

## 🔹 Why Terraform? (Importance)

* **Automation** – No more manual setup; everything is automated with code.
* **Consistency** – Same infrastructure every time, across multiple environments (dev, test, prod).
* **Collaboration** – Teams can work together using version-controlled configuration files.
* **Multi-Cloud Support** – Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and many others.
* **Scalability** – Makes it easy to scale infrastructure up or down.

---

## 🚀 Key Uses of Terraform

* Provisioning cloud resources like **VMs, databases, storage, and networking**.
* Managing **multi-cloud environments** in one place.
* Automating **infrastructure deployments** in CI/CD pipelines.
* Creating **immutable infrastructure** (safe, repeatable builds).
* Managing **Kubernetes clusters** and container-based deployments.
* Building reusable **infrastructure modules** for teams.

---

## ✅ Advantages of Terraform

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Infrastructure is defined in human-readable code (`.tf` files).
* **Execution Plan** – See what changes will happen before applying.
* **State Management** – Tracks resources so it knows what’s already deployed.
* **Idempotent** – Running the same code multiple times produces the same results.
* **Open-Source & Extensible** – Large community and a rich **Terraform Registry** with thousands of modules.
* **Portable** – Not tied to one cloud provider.

## 🛠 Terraform Workflow

1. **Write** – Define resources in `.tf` configuration files.
2. **Init** – Initialize the working directory (`terraform init`).
3. **Plan** – Preview changes (`terraform plan`).
4. **Apply** – Deploy resources (`terraform apply`).
5. **Destroy** – Remove resources when no longer needed (`terraform destroy`).
